https://css-tricks.com/better-tabs-ith-round-out-borders/, but I don't really
understand the Pseudo-elements that they're talking about*/

/* Do you want the buttons to look more like tabs or to have rounded corners?  Tabs are pretty hard, but
 * rounded corners are easier.  You can use the "border-radius" property for that:
 *
 *     border-radius: 5px; 
 *
 * You can play around with the value; the larger the number, the rounder the corner.
 *
 * Pseudo-elements are harder and I may not be able to get to them in class, but this is a great article on them:
